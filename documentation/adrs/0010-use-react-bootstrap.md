# Architectural Decision Record: Use React Bootstrap for Styling

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Case Management System (CMS) frontend is built with React and TypeScript. The team requires a modern, consistent, and responsive UI framework that integrates well with React, supports rapid development, and is easy to maintain. Several options were considered, including Material UI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, and React Bootstrap.

## Decision

We will use **React Bootstrap** as the primary styling and component library for the CMS frontend.

## Consequences

- Provides a large set of accessible, responsive, and well-documented components.
- Integrates seamlessly with React and supports TypeScript typings.
- Leverages Bootstrap's familiar grid and utility classes, reducing the learning curve for developers with Bootstrap experience.
- Enables rapid prototyping and consistent UI/UX across the application.
- May require custom theming or overrides for advanced branding needs.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Material UI**: Feature-rich and popular, but introduces a Material Design look that may not fit all branding needs.
- **Chakra UI**: Modern and flexible, but a smaller ecosystem and less Bootstrap familiarity.
- **Ant Design**: Comprehensive, but heavier and more opinionated in design.
- **Custom CSS/SCSS**: Maximum flexibility, but slower development and less consistency.
