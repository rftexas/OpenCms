# Architectural Decision Record: Frontend Framework â€“ React with TypeScript vs Angular vs Vue

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Case Management System (CMS) requires a modern, maintainable, and scalable frontend framework. The main options considered are **React with TypeScript**, **Angular**, and **Vue**. All three are widely adopted, support component-based architectures, and have strong community support.

## Decision Drivers

- Team experience and learning curve
- Ecosystem and third-party library support
- Type safety and maintainability
- Integration with existing tooling and CI/CD
- Long-term scalability and community support

## Options

### 1. React with TypeScript

**Pros:**
- Flexible, unopinionated, and easy to integrate with other libraries
- Large ecosystem and community
- TypeScript adds type safety and better tooling
- Faster learning curve for teams familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript
- Easier incremental adoption

**Cons:**
- Requires manual setup for state management, routing, and form handling
- Less built-in structure; risk of inconsistent patterns without strong guidelines

### 2. Angular

**Pros:**
- Complete, opinionated framework with built-in solutions (routing, forms, HTTP, state, etc.)
- Strong TypeScript support by default
- CLI tooling for scaffolding and testing
- Enforces architectural consistency

**Cons:**
- Steeper learning curve, especially for teams new to Angular
- Larger bundle sizes and more boilerplate
- Less flexibility for integrating non-Angular libraries

### 3. Vue (with TypeScript)

**Pros:**
- Progressive framework: easy to adopt incrementally
- Simpler learning curve than Angular, approachable for beginners
- Good TypeScript support (especially in Vue 3)
- Flexible and lightweight, with official solutions for routing and state management
- Clean and readable single-file components

**Cons:**
- Smaller ecosystem and enterprise adoption compared to React and Angular
- Some advanced TypeScript integrations can be less intuitive than React/Angular
- Fewer large-scale, enterprise case studies

## Decision

We will use **React with TypeScript** as the frontend framework for the Case Management System.

## Consequences

- The team benefits from a flexible, widely adopted, and type-safe framework.
- Faster onboarding and development due to familiarity and ecosystem size.
- Requires establishing and enforcing architectural guidelines for consistency.
- Enables easy integration with third-party libraries and tools.
