# Architectural Decision Record: Use a Modular Monolith in Dotnet for the API Layer

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Case Management System (CMS) requires a robust, maintainable, and scalable backend architecture for its API layer. The main architectural options considered were a modular monolith, microservices, and a traditional layered monolith. The API must support:

- Clear separation of business domains (e.g., Cases, Users, Organizations, Categories)
- Maintainability and testability
- Efficient development and deployment for a small-to-medium team
- Integration with PostgreSQL, Keycloak, and other services
- Flexibility for future evolution (e.g., migration to microservices if needed)

## Decision

We will implement the API layer as a **modular monolith** using **.NET**.

## Consequences

- Each business domain is encapsulated in its own module, enforcing boundaries and reducing coupling.
- Simplifies deployment and operational complexity compared to microservices.
- Enables efficient local development and debugging.
- Facilitates code sharing and reuse across modules.
- Provides a clear path to future decomposition into microservices if scaling needs arise.
- Requires discipline to maintain module boundaries within a single codebase.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Microservices**: Offers independent deployment and scaling, but adds significant operational and architectural complexity not justified at the current scale.
- **Traditional Monolith**: Simple, but risks tight coupling and lack of clear domain boundaries, making future scaling and maintenance harder.
