The main architectural options considered were a modular monolith, microservices, and a traditional layered monolith. The API must support:\n\n- Clear separation of business domains (e.g., Cases, Users, Organizations, Categories)\n- Maintainability and testability\n- Efficient development and deployment for a small-to-medium team\n- Integration with PostgreSQL, Keycloak, and other services\n- Flexibility for future evolution (e.g., migration to microservices if needed)\n\n## Decision\n\nWe will implement the API layer as a **modular monolith** using **.NET**.\n\n## Consequences\n\n- Each business domain is encapsulated in its own module, enforcing boundaries and reducing coupling.\n- Simplifies deployment and operational complexity compared to microservices.\n- Enables efficient local development and debugging.\n- Facilitates code sharing and reuse across modules.\n- Provides a clear path to future decomposition into microservices if scaling needs arise.\n- Requires discipline to maintain module boundaries within a single codebase.\n\n## Alternatives Considered\n\n- **Microservices**: Offers independent deployment and scaling, but adds significant operational and architectural complexity not justified at the current scale.\n- **Traditional Monolith**: Simple, but risks tight coupling and lack of clear domain boundaries, making future scaling and maintenance harder.\n\n## Related Decisions\n\n- [ADR-0001: Use PostgreSQL as the Database](./#1)\n- [ADR-0003: Frontend Framework – React with TypeScript](./#3)\n\n## References\n\n- [Microsoft Docs: Modular Monoliths](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures#modular-monolithic-architecture)\n-",
