## Acceptance Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Organization Creation and Setup
```
Given I am logged in as a Super User
When I navigate to the organization management interface
And I click "Add Organization"
And I enter organization details (Name: "New Corp", Domain: "newcorp.com")
And I assign "admin@newcorp.com" as the initial administrator
And I save the organization
Then the organization should be created with Active status
And the administrator should receive account setup credentials
And the organization should appear in the organization list
And the action should be logged in the system audit trail
```

### Scenario 2: Organization Administrator Assignment
```
Given I am a Super User
And an organization "ACME Corp" exists
When I edit the organization
And I change the administrator from "old@acme.com" to "new@acme.com"
Then the new administrator should receive access credentials
And the old administrator should lose organization admin privileges
And the change should be audited with timestamp and user details
```

### Scenario 3: Organization Deactivation
```
Given I am a Super User
And an organization "Test Corp" exists with Active status
When I deactivate the organization
Then the organization status should change to Inactive
And all users in that organization should lose system access
And existing case data should be preserved according to retention policies
And a deactivation audit record should be created
```

### Scenario 4: System-Wide Audit Log Access
```
Given I am a Super User
When I access the system audit logs
And I filter by organization "ACME Corp" and action type "User Creation"
Then I should see all user creation events for that organization
And each log entry should include timestamp, user, action, and details
And I should be able to export the filtered results
```

### Scenario 5: Cross-Organization Reporting
```
Given I am a Super User
When I generate a cross-organization report
And I select metrics for "Active Cases" and "User Count"
Then I should see aggregated data across all organizations
And I should be able to drill down into organization-specific details
And I should be able to export the report for analysis
```
