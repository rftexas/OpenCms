# User Story: Password Reset

## Title
Password Reset Functionality for Case Management System

## As a
User who has forgotten my password

## I want to
Request a password reset via email and securely set a new password

## So that
I can regain access to my account without requiring administrator intervention

---

### Acceptance Criteria

- The user can access a "Forgot Password" link from the login page.
- The user enters their registered email address to request a password reset.
- The system validates that the email address exists in the system.
- If the email exists, a secure reset token is generated and sent via email.
- If the email doesn't exist, a generic message is shown (for security reasons).
- The password reset email contains a time-limited, single-use token/link.
- The reset token expires after 1 hour for security purposes.
- The user can click the reset link to access a secure password reset form.
- The reset form validates the token and allows setting a new password.
- The new password must meet the system's complexity requirements.
- Once the password is successfully reset, the token is invalidated.
- The user receives confirmation that their password has been changed.
- The user is redirected to the login page to sign in with their new password.
- Rate limiting prevents abuse of the password reset functionality.
- All password reset activities are logged for audit purposes.
- The reset process works on both desktop and mobile devices.

### Technical Notes

- Password reset tokens are stored in the `PasswordResetTokens` collection on the `User` entity.
- Tokens are generated using `CreatePasswordResetToken()` method which creates a GUID-based token.
- The system uses the existing email infrastructure for sending reset notifications.
- Token validation ensures single use and expiration time checking.

### Security Considerations

- Reset tokens are cryptographically secure and unpredictable.
- Email enumeration attacks are mitigated by showing generic success messages.
- Rate limiting prevents automated attacks on the reset endpoint.
- Tokens are automatically cleaned up after expiration.
- All reset attempts are logged with IP addresses and timestamps.
