#### 7. Organization Data Isolation

**As a** User

- Super Users can access data across all organizations
- Cross-organization data leakage is prevented

### Technical Notes

- Organizations are implemented as `Tenant` entities in the backend
- The `UserTenant` junction table links users to organizations with roles
- Organization data is filtered using the `TenantId` throughout the system
- Super Users have cross-organization access via role checking
- API endpoints use tenant-aware repositories for data access
- Frontend components use organization context for data display

---

### Security Considerations

- Organization access is strictly controlled through role-based permissions
- Data isolation is enforced at the database and API levels
- Organization administrators cannot elevate their own privileges
- All organization management actions are logged for audit purposes
- Tenant context is validated on every data operation
- Cross-tenant data access is only allowed for Super Users
